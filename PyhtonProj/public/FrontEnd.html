The attacks are so obvious that it doesn't take much investigation to confirm that your business has been attacked or that an incident should be declared.  The exception would be a spam email that demands ransom in exchange for supposedly compromising materials.  In this case, these types of incidents should be dealt with as spam unless the email contains highly specific information.</td>
