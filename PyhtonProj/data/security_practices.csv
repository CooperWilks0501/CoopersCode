A growing threat,"Ransomware attacks are one of the biggest security challenges facing businesses today. When successful, ransomware attacks can disable a business core IT infrastructure, and cause destruction that could have a debilitating impact on the physical, economic security or safety of a business. Ransomware attacks are targeted to businesses of all types. This requires that all businesses take preventive measures to ensure protection.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,General Security
A growing threat,"Recent trends on the number of attacks are alarming. While 2020 wasn't a good year for ransomware attacks on businesses, 2021 started on a bad trajectory.  On May 7, the Colonial pipeline (Colonial) attack shut down services such as pipeline transportation of diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel were temporary halted. Colonial shut the critical fuel network supplying the populous eastern states.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,Network Security
A growing threat,"Historically, cyberattacks were seen as a sophisticated set of actions targeting particular industries, which left the remaining industries believing they were outside the scope of cybercrime, and without context about which cybersecurity threats they should prepare for. Ransomware represents a major shift in this threat landscape, and it's made cyberattacks a real and omnipresent danger for everyone. Encrypted and lost files and threatening ransom notes have now become the top-of-mind fear for most executive teams.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,General Security
A growing threat,Ransomware's economic model capitalizes on the misperception that a ransomware attack is solely a malware incident. Whereas in reality ransomware is a breach involving human adversaries attacking a network.,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,Network Security
A growing threat,"For many organizations, the cost to rebuild from scratch after a ransomware incident far outweighs the original ransom demanded. With a limited understanding of the threat landscape and how ransomware operates, paying the ransom seems like the better business decision to return to operations. However, the real damage is often done when the cybercriminal exfiltrates files for release or sale, while leaving backdoors in the network for future criminal activityâand these risks persist whether or not the ransom is paid.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,Network Security
What is ransomware,"Ransomware will typically exploit the weaknesses or vulnerabilities in your organization's IT systems or infrastructures to succeed. The attacks are so obvious that it doesn't take much investigation to confirm that your business has been attacked or that an incident should be declared.  The exception would be a spam email that demands ransom in exchange for supposedly compromising materials.  In this case, these types of incidents should be dealt with as spam unless the email contains highly specific information.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,General Security
What is ransomware,"Any business or organization that operates an IT system with data in it can be attacked.   Although individuals can be targeted in a ransomware attack,  most attacks are targeted at businesses. While the Colonial ransomware attack of May 2021 drew considerable public attention, our Detection and Response team (DART)'s ransomware engagement data shows that the energy sector represents one of the most targeted sectors, along with the financial, healthcare, and entertainment sectors.

Why attacks succeed,"Attackers use different techniques, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attack to exploit vulnerabilities.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,General Security
Should you pay?,There are varying opinions on what the best option is when confronted with this vexing demand.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) advises victims not to pay ransom but to instead be vigilant and take proactive measures to secure their data before an attack.  They contend that paying doesn't guarantee that locked systems and encrypted data are released again. The FBI says another reason not to pay is that payments to cyber criminals incentivize them to continue to attack organizations,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,General Security
Should you pay?,"Nevertheless, some victims elect to pay the ransom demand even though system and data access isn't guaranteed after paying the ransom. By paying, such organizations take the calculated risk to pay in hopes of getting back their system and data and quickly resuming normal operations.  Part of the calculation is reduction in collateral costs such as lost productivity, decreased revenue over time, exposure of sensitive data, and potential reputational damage.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/ransomware-protection,Data Protection
Should you pay?,"The best way to prevent paying ransom isn't to fall victim by implementing preventive measures and having tool saturation to protect your organization from every step that attacker takes wholly or incrementally to hack into your system. In addition, having the ability to recover impacted assets ensure restoration of business operations in a timely fashion.
